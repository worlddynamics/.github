## The World Dynamics Project

The World Dynamics project aims to provide a modern framework to investigate [integrated assessment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling) of sustainable development, based on current software engineering and scientific machine learning techniques. 
Our group is developing a Julia library to allow scientists to easily use and adapt different world models, from [Meadows et al.'s World3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3) to recent proposals. 
By enabling an open, interdisciplinary, and consistent comparative approach to scientific model development, our goal is to inform global policy makers on environmental and economic issues.
